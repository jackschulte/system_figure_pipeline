# One-page figure plot pipeline

This pipeline is currently being built to easily generate single-system full-page figures for Jack Schulte's MEEP I / Cargo III paper.

The full-page figures generated by this pipeline include a stacked transit plot, RV vs. Time, RV vs. Phase, SED, and a MIST evolutionary track plot. This pipeline only works with outputs from EXOFASTv2. To generate these figures, lots of input files (or output files from EXOFASTv2) are needed. These files are listed below:
- All of the 'mcmc.detrendedmodel' files from the transits
- All of the 'mcmc.prettymodel' files from the transits
- All of the 'mcmc.residuals' files from the transits
- The 'mcmc.model.telescope_##' files from each of the RV telescopes
- The 'mcmc.rv.ps.prettymodelrv.planet' file
- The 'mcmc.sed.residuals.txt' file
- The 'median.csv' file
- The 'mcmc.idl' file (the IDL save file for the fit)
